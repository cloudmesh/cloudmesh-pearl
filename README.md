This command will help you to interact with perl from a remote machine easily.
The reason we wrote this program instead of using ssh directly is to focus on
the development of code on your local computer before you run them on perl.

To use the command you have to install it with pip in python3 virtualenv

If you do not have a venv you can create one on Linux with

```bash
$ python3 -m venv ~/ENV3
$ source ~/ENV3/bin/activate 
```

and on Windows with 

```bash
$ python -m venv ~/ENV3
$ source ~/ENV3/bin/activate 
```
